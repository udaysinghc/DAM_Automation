Feature:  Custom Permissions Testing - Group Permissions
  As a user who is set up as a member of a group
  I want my custom access permissions to be as configured
  So I can have the correct access to Resources

  Background:
    Given 'User1' is in the group 'UserGroup1' only

  Scenario: Custom Folder Permissions
    Given 'UserGroup1' has 'No' group General Permissions
    When 'User1' has navigated to 'Resources'
    Then 'User1' can perform the following folder actions:
      | Folder | Add File | Delete | Create Sub Folder | Change Settings |
      | C1     | Yes      | Yes    | Yes               | Yes             |
      | C2     | Yes      | No     | No                | No              |
      | C3     | No       | No     | No                | No              |
      | C4     | No       | No     | No                | No              |
